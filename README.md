# Parsely Tracking on iOS

This repository contains the code necessary to build and test the Parsely tracking framework for iOS. It also includes a basic sample iOS app that can be used to interactively experiment with Parsely tracking.

The `ParselyAnalytics` SDK is available via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/ParselyAnalytics).

## Including ParselyAnalytics in a project

First, set up a local CocoaPods environment if you haven't already:

    $ sudo gem install cocoapods

Then add the following to your the project's Podfile:

    pod 'ParselyAnalytics'

Then, run `pod install` to install `ParselyAnalytics` as a dependency.

## Using the tracker

In any file that uses Parsely Analytics functionality, include `import ParselyTracker`

At app startup, initialize the `Parsely` singleton. A good place to do this might be the top-level application delegate:
```
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    self.parsely = Parsely.sharedInstance
    // other app initialization
    return true
}
```
Once you've done this, you can call tracking methods on `self.parsely`:
```
self.parsely.trackPageView(url: "http://mysite.com/story1")
self.parsely.startEngagement(url: "http://mysite.com/story2")
self.parsely.stopEngagement()
```

## Design Notes

To conserve battery usage and network bandwidth, the SDK will batch pixel requests as they are made, 
and flush them periodically. Each pixel retains its creation timestamp regardless of when it was sent. 
Upon app shutdown, or when the app is backgrounded, it will flush whatever pixels are currently in the queue.
